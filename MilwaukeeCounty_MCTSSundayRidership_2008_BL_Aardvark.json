{"dct_title_s": "MCTS Sunday Ridership Milwaukee County, Wisconsin 2008","dct_description_sm": ["This point data layer represents MCTS ridership on Sundays for 2008. AGSL staff created the point data layer using the Sunday.dbf file that was originally published by the Milwaukee County Transit System (MCTS) in 2008.[Total_On and Total_Off fields are the most useful for average daily ridership by bus stop. I also joined a bus stops file in order to have a complete NAME field which indicates the corner/bus stop geography, and any of the Lat/Long or X,Y fields are OK to use for plotting on a map (X3,Y3 has UTM coords). Remember also that there may be multiple points at one location because some bus stops are used by several routes but the ons/offs are recorded individually by route/stop, not just by stop alone.]"],"dct_language_sm": ["eng"],"dct_creator_sm": ["Milwaukee County Transit System (MCTS)"],"schema_provider_s": "American Geographical Society Library â€“ UWM Libraries","gbl_resourceClass_sm": ["Datasets"],"gbl_resourceType_sm": ["Point data"],"dcat_theme_sm": ["Transportation"],"dct_temporal_sm": ["2008"],"dct_issued_s": "2008","gbl_indexYear_im": [2008],"dct_spatial_sm": ["Milwaukee County","Wisconsin"],"locn_geometry": "ENVELOPE(-87.840369, -88.119263, 43.19351, 42.883145)","dcat_bbox": "ENVELOPE(-88.119263, -87.840369, 43.19351, 42.883145)","dct_rights_sm": ["<a href=\"https://uwm.edu/libraries/digital-collections/copyright-digcoll/\">Please see the UWM Libraries statement on Copyright and Digital Collections</a>.","Although this data is being distributed by the American Geographical Society Library at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Libraries, no warranty expressed or implied is made by the University as to the accuracy of the data and related materials.
