The dataset was originally published by the Door County Real Property Listing Office in 2015.[The Tax Parcel map of Door County, Wisconsin. This was derived from a variety of source maps including survey plats, deed descriptions, subdivision maps, certified survey maps, easements, and right-of-way plats. These source materials were of several different scales and were from dates ranging from the late 1800's to the present. This map provides a useful representation of the geometry and topology of tax parcels and is suitable for its intended purpose. It is not, however, meant to be used for the determination of land ownership and interest descriptions contained in individual deeds.]"],"dct_language_sm": ["eng"],"dct_creator_sm": ["Door County Land Information Office","Door County Real Property Listing Office"],"dct_publisher_sm": ["Door County Real Property Listing Office"],"schema_provider_s": "American Geographical Society Library â€“ UWM Libraries","gbl_resourceClass_sm": ["Datasets"],"gbl_resourceType_sm": ["Polygon data"],"dcat_theme_sm": ["Property"],"dct_temporal_sm": ["2015"],"dct_issued_s": "2015","gbl_indexYear_im": [2015],"dct_spatial_sm": ["Door County","Wisconsin"],"locn_geometry": "ENVELOPE(-86.804019, -87.73648, 45.449268, 44.655804)","dcat_bbox": "ENVELOPE(-87.73648, -86.804019, 45.449268, 44.655804)","dct_rights_sm": ["<a href=\"https://uwm.edu/libraries/digital-collections/copyright-digcoll/\">Please see the UWM Libraries statement on Copyright and Digital Collections</a>.[This information is NOT to be used for describing actual or true property ownership or title.]","Although this data is being distributed by the American Geographical Society Library at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Libraries, no warranty expressed or implied is made by the University as to the accuracy of the data and related materials.
