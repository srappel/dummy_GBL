{"dct_title_s": "Hydro Line Milwaukee County, Wisconsin 1944-1994","dct_description_sm": ["This line data layer represents hydrography for Milwaukee County, Wisconsin in 1944-1994. The dataset was originally published by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources in November 2005.[This shapefile includes all Simple Hydro Areas (SHAIDs) in the 1:24,000-scale Hydrography data model (Version 5). SHAIDS include hydrographic features only and do not contain islands or uplands. SHAIDs contain various descriptive attributes, including names and Water Body ID Codes (WBICs).The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) developed this statewide Hydrography geographic data layer from 1:24,000-scale sources. The 1:24K Hydrography database includes information about surface water features represented on the US Geological Survey's 1:24,000-scale topographic map series such as perennial and intermittent streams, lakes, and so on. A large portion of the DNR's Waterbody Identification Codes (WBICs) have been incorporated into the 24K Hydro layer, along with surface water names from the USGS Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) database. Wetlands delineations are NOT included in the 24K Hydro data layer.Following the initial release of the 24K Hydrography database in October of 2000, a series of data updates and enhancements have culminated in Version 5 of the 24K Hydro layer, which was completed in November 2005. Version 5 includes data enhancements and corrections.]"],"dct_language_sm": ["eng"],"dct_creator_sm": ["Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources"],"schema_provider_s": "American Geographical Society Library â€“ UWM Libraries","gbl_resourceClass_sm": ["Datasets"],"gbl_resourceType_sm": ["Line data"],"dcat_theme_sm": ["Inland Waters"],"dct_temporal_sm": ["1944 to 1994"],"dct_issued_s": "2005","gbl_indexYear_im": [1944,1945,1946,1947,1948,1949,1950,1951,1952,1953,1954,1955,1956,1957,1958,1959,1960,1961,1962,1963,1964,1965,1966,1967,1968,1969,1970,1971,1972,1973,1974,1975,1976,1977,1978,1979,1980,1981,1982,1983,1984,1985,1986,1987,1988,1989,1990,1991,1992,1993,1994],"gbl_dateRange_drsim" : "[1944 TO 1994]","dct_spatial_sm": ["Milwaukee County","Wisconsin"],"locn_geometry": "ENVELOPE(-87.813019, -88.074507, 43.195101, 42.839343)","dcat_bbox": "ENVELOPE(-88.074507, -87.813019, 43.195101, 42.839343)","dct_rights_sm": ["<a href=\"https://uwm.edu/libraries/digital-collections/copyright-digcoll/\">Please see the UWM Libraries statement on Copyright and Digital Collections</a>.","Although this data is being distributed by the American Geographical Society Library at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Libraries, no warranty expressed or implied is made by the University as to the accuracy of the data and related materials.
