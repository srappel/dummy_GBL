{"dct_title_s": "Municipalities Illinois 2000","dct_description_sm": ["This polygon data layer represents municipalities for Illinois in 2000. The dataset was originally published by the Illinois State Geological Survey on April 25, 2006.[This polygon feature class shows incorporated places and census designated places in Illinois as of the 2000 US census. The data are identical to that provided by the US Census except that field names have been changed or fields deleted to conform with data already in use at the ISGS. The metadata are for the most part from the original Census Dept. metadata with minor additons by the ISGS. The attribute data include FIPS place ID, name, and type of municipality. Boundaries are generalized from the original TIGER data. Incorporated places recognized in decennial US census data products are those reported to the U.S. Census Bureau as legally in existence on January 1, 2000, under the laws of their respective states, as cities, boroughs, towns, and villages. Census designated places (CDPs) are delineated for each decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located. These are generalized cartographic boundaries originally produced to support the spatial geographic infrastructure for certain mapping functions within the Census Bureau's American Fact Finder and in support of the LandView Geographic Data Viewer. The data are a generalized extraction from the Census Bureau's TIGER database. The suggested scale for use of these data is 1:5,000,000. The data were obtained from the US Census website.]"],"dct_language_sm": ["eng"],"dct_creator_sm": ["Illinois State Geological Survey","United States Census Bureau"],"dct_publisher_sm": ["Illinois State Geological Survey"],"schema_provider_s": "American Geographical Society Library â€“ UWM Libraries","gbl_resourceClass_sm": ["Datasets"],"gbl_resourceType_sm": ["Polygon data"],"dcat_theme_sm": ["Boundaries"],"dct_temporal_sm": ["2000"],"dct_issued_s": "2006","gbl_indexYear_im": [2000],"dct_spatial_sm": ["Illinois"],"locn_geometry": "ENVELOPE(-87.522576, -91.466901, 42.508284, 36.970298)","dcat_bbox": "ENVELOPE(-91.466901, -87.522576, 42.508284, 36.970298)","dct_rights_sm": ["<a href=\"https://uwm.edu/libraries/digital-collections/copyright-digcoll/\">Please see the UWM Libraries statement on Copyright and Digital Collections</a>.[Reproduction or redistribution of copyrighted digital data sets or products derived therefrom outside of licensee's organization or entity is expressly forbidden.
