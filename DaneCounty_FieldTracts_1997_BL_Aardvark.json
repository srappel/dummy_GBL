The dataset was originally published by the Dane County and Information Office in 1997 as Coverage format. AGSL Staff converted to shapefile and simplified the data for ease of use.[This layer is a polygon coverage that delineates the field tract boundaries, divided by township, for Dane County at 1:12,000 scale. The coverage's were created by digitizing off of Mylar plots of the parcel boundaries that was registered over an orthophoto. The fields were then delineated by tracing arcs from the parcel coverage. The line coding coincides with the line coding from the parcel coverage.]"],"dct_language_sm": ["eng"],"dct_creator_sm": ["Dane County Land Information Office"],"schema_provider_s": "American Geographical Society Library - UWM Libraries","gbl_resourceClass_sm": ["Datasets"],"gbl_resourceType_sm": ["Polygon data"],"dcat_theme_sm": ["Agriculture","Property"],"dct_temporal_sm": ["1997"],"dct_issued_s": "1996","gbl_indexYear_im": [1997],"dct_spatial_sm": ["Dane County","Wisconsin"],"locn_geometry": "ENVELOPE(-89.001202, -89.849705, 43.304439, 42.839046)","dcat_bbox": "ENVELOPE(-89.849705, -89.001202, 43.304439, 42.839046)","dct_rights_sm": ["<a href=\"https://uwm.edu/libraries/digital-collections/copyright-digcoll/\">Please see the UWM Libraries statement on Copyright and Digital Collections</a>.","Although this data is being distributed by the American Geographical Society Library at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Libraries, no warranty expressed or implied is made by the University as to the accuracy of the data and related materials.
