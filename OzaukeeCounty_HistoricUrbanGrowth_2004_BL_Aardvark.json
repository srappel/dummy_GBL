The polygon features were digitized from delineations prepared from aerial photographs, historical maps and records, and other reference materials. The data set contains the approximated boundaries of urbanized development for selected years from 1850 to 1995. The historic urban growth polygons are identified according to year of urban development.]"],"dct_language_sm": ["eng"],"dct_creator_sm": ["Southeast Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission-Land Use Division and GIS Division"],"schema_provider_s": "American Geographical Society Library â€“ UWM Libraries","gbl_resourceClass_sm": ["Datasets"],"gbl_resourceType_sm": ["Polygon data"],"dcat_theme_sm": ["Property","Boundaries"],"dct_temporal_sm": ["2004-08-26"],"dct_issued_s": "2004","gbl_indexYear_im": [2004],"dct_spatial_sm": ["Ozaukee County","Wisconsin"],"locn_geometry": "ENVELOPE(-87.788907, -88.067867, 43.547754, 43.187374)","dcat_bbox": "ENVELOPE(-88.067867, -87.788907, 43.547754, 43.187374)","dct_rights_sm": ["<a href=\"https://uwm.edu/libraries/digital-collections/copyright-digcoll/\">Please see the UWM Libraries statement on Copyright and Digital Collections</a>.[There are no legal prerequisites for accessing this data set.
