{"dct_title_s": "Roads Michigan 2009","dct_description_sm": ["This line data layer represents roads for Michigan in 2009. The dataset was originally published by the Michigan Center for Geographic Information on May 1, 2009.[This data set is part of the Michigan Geographic Framework. The framework serves as the digital base map for State of Michigan government. Currently the geographic framework contains features including roads, rivers, lakes, streams, railroads, political jurisdiction boundaries, school district boundaries, census area tabulation boundaries and legislative district boundaries. Specifically, this Michigan base map will consist of an Arc Info coverage which includes features and attributes based on the current TIGER/Line Files, base map features based on both the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) Michigan Resource Information System (MIRIS) Files and an enhanced linear referencing system built from the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) Michigan Accident Location Index (MALI). The Geographic Framework will serve as a common and standardized infrastructure on which all GIS users of 1:24,000 scale map data can build their applications. At the heart of the Geographic Framework will be the ability to administer programs that use location-based information and need to relate one database to another geographically. Version 9b replaces Version 8a as the current version of the Michigan Geographic Framework (MGF). A primary driving force in the creation of Framework Version 9b was the continued reconciliation of the road network and city/village boundaries with current information. Changes incorporated in version 9b of the MGF are described in the following documents: MGF_V9b_Updates, MGF_V9b_Trunkline_Updates These and other documents related to MGF can be found at: ]"],"dct_language_sm": ["eng"],"dct_creator_sm": ["Michigan Center for Geographic Information"],"dct_publisher_sm": ["Michigan Center for Geographic Information"],"schema_provider_s": "American Geographical Society Library â€“ UWM Libraries","gbl_resourceClass_sm": ["Datasets"],"gbl_resourceType_sm": ["Line data"],"dcat_theme_sm": ["Transportation"],"dct_temporal_sm": ["1997 to 2009-05-01"],"dct_issued_s": "2009","gbl_indexYear_im": [1997,1998,1999,2000,2001,2002,2003,2004,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009],"gbl_dateRange_drsim" : "[1997 TO 2009]","dct_spatial_sm": ["Michigan"],"locn_geometry": "ENVELOPE(-82.130097, -90.485309, 47.496435, 41.63216)","dcat_bbox": "ENVELOPE(-90.485309, -82.130097, 47.496435, 41.63216)","dct_rights_sm": ["<a href=\"https://uwm.edu/libraries/digital-collections/copyright-digcoll/\">Please see the UWM Libraries statement on Copyright and Digital Collections</a>.","Although this data is being distributed by the American Geographical Society Library at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Libraries, no warranty expressed or implied is made by the University as to the accuracy of the data and related materials.
