The polygon features were delineated on 1\"=400' scale aerial photographs and board digitized. The data set was collected at approximately 5-year intervals, and is current for the years 1963, 1970, 1980, 1985, 1990, 1995, and 2000. The land use polygons are identified according to the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission's (SEWRPC) land use classification system.]"],"dct_language_sm": ["eng"],"dct_creator_sm": ["Southeast Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission-Land Use Division and GIS Division"],"schema_provider_s": "American Geographical Society Library â€“ UWM Libraries","gbl_resourceClass_sm": ["Datasets"],"gbl_resourceType_sm": ["Polygon data"],"dcat_theme_sm": ["Property"],"dct_temporal_sm": ["1995"],"dct_issued_s": "2000","gbl_indexYear_im": [1995],"dct_spatial_sm": ["Milwaukee County","Wisconsin"],"locn_geometry": "ENVELOPE(-87.813016, -88.074273, 43.195048, 42.838881)","dcat_bbox": "ENVELOPE(-88.074273, -87.813016, 43.195048, 42.838881)","dct_rights_sm": ["<a href=\"https://uwm.edu/libraries/digital-collections/copyright-digcoll/\">Please see the UWM Libraries statement on Copyright and Digital Collections</a>.
