The dataset was originally published by the Southeast Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission (SEWRPC) in 2002.[This data set contains polygon features of planned environmental corridors and planned isolated natural resource areas for the seven county Southeastern Wisconsin Region. It is a companion to the SEWRPC Environmental Corridor Inventory data set. The planned environmental corridor data set is the inventory environmental corridor data set adjusted to reflect planned additions to, and deletions from, the inventory environmental corridors and isolated natural resource areas identified in the regional land use plan, water quality management plan, or park and open space plan, including amendments to these plans, adopted by the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission. The polygon features were derived from existing environmental corridor inventory data sets for the years 1990, 1995, and 2000 (the existing environmental corridor data sets were originally extracted from land use inventory maps and 1\"=400' scale aerial photographs). The polygon features consist of planned primary and planned secondary environmental corridor areas and planned isolated natural resource areas as defined by SEWRPC.]"],"dct_language_sm": ["eng"],"dct_creator_sm": ["Southeast Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission-Land Use Division and GIS Division"],"schema_provider_s": "American Geographical Society Library â€“ UWM Libraries","gbl_resourceClass_sm": ["Datasets"],"gbl_resourceType_sm": ["Polygon data"],"dcat_theme_sm": ["Environment"],"dct_temporal_sm": ["2000"],"gbl_indexYear_im": [2000],"dct_spatial_sm": ["Waukesha County","Wisconsin"],"locn_geometry": "ENVELOPE(-88.058803, -88.545812, 43.19919, 42.835889)","dcat_bbox": "ENVELOPE(-88.545812, -88.058803, 43.19919, 42.835889)","dct_rights_sm": ["Please see the UWM Libraries statement on Copyright and Digitial Collections.
