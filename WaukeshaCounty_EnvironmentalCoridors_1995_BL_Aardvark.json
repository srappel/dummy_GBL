The dataset was originally published by the Southeast Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission (SEWRPC) in 2002.[This data set contains polygon features of existing environmental corridors and isolated natural resource areas for the seven county Southeastern Wisconsin region. The polygon features were delineated on land use inventory maps, with reference to 1\"\"=400' scale aerial photographs, and digitized from these source materials. The data set was collected at 5-year intervals, and is current for the years 1990 and 1995. The polygons consist of primary and secondary environmental corridor areas and isolated natural resource areas as defined by SEWRPC.]"],"dct_language_sm": ["eng"],"dct_creator_sm": ["Southeast Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission-Land Use Division and GIS Division"],"schema_provider_s": "American Geographical Society Library â€“ UWM Libraries","gbl_resourceClass_sm": ["Datasets"],"gbl_resourceType_sm": ["Polygon data"],"dcat_theme_sm": ["Environment"],"dct_temporal_sm": ["1995"],"dct_issued_s": "2002","gbl_indexYear_im": [1995],"dct_spatial_sm": ["Waukesha County","Wisconsin"],"locn_geometry": "ENVELOPE(-88.058803, -88.545812, 43.19919, 42.835889)","dcat_bbox": "ENVELOPE(-88.545812, -88.058803, 43.19919, 42.835889)","dct_rights_sm": ["Please see the UWM Libraries statement on Copyright and Digitial Collections.
