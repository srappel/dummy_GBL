{"dct_title_s": "TIGER Primary and Secondary Roads Wisconsin 2012","dct_description_sm": ["This line data layer represents primary and secondary roads in Wisconsin in 2012. The dataset was originally published by the United States Census Bureau in 2012.[The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Primary roads are generally divided, limited-access highways within the interstate highway system or under State management, and are distinguished by the presence of interchanges. These highways are accessible by ramps and may include some toll highways. The MAF/TIGER Feature Classification Code (MTFCC) is S1100 for primary roads. Secondary roads are main arteries, usually in the U.S. Highway, State Highway, and/or County Highway system. These roads have one or more lanes of traffic in each direction, may or may not be divided, and usually have at-grade intersections with many other roads and driveways. They usually have both a local name and a route number. The MAF/TIGER Feature Classification Code (MTFCC) is S1200 for secondary roads.]"],"dct_language_sm": ["eng"],"dct_creator_sm": ["United States Census Bureau"],"schema_provider_s": "American Geographical Society Library â€“ UWM Libraries","gbl_resourceClass_sm": ["Datasets"],"gbl_resourceType_sm": ["Line data"],"dcat_theme_sm": ["Transportation"],"dct_temporal_sm": ["2011-08-01 to 2012-06-01"],"dct_issued_s": "2012","gbl_indexYear_im": [2011,2012],"gbl_dateRange_drsim" : "[2011 TO 2012]","dct_spatial_sm": ["Wisconsin"],"locn_geometry": "ENVELOPE(-86.978219, -92.804463, 46.899167, 42.492802)","dcat_bbox": "ENVELOPE(-92.804463, -86.978219, 46.899167, 42.492802)","dct_rights_sm": ["<a href=\"https://uwm.edu/libraries/digital-collections/copyright-digcoll/\">Please see the UWM Libraries statement on Copyright and Digital Collections</a>.[The TIGER/Line Shapefile products are not copyrighted however TIGER/Line and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the U.S. Census Bureau.
