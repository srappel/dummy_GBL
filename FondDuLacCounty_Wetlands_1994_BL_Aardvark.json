The dataset was originally published by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources in 2006.[Wetlands for Fond du Lac County, WI. The data layer is in Wisconsin Transverse Mercator (WTM) projection system, North American Datum 1983 with the 1991 adjustments.][The wetland layer includes a series of polygon coverages/shapefiles and point coverages/shapefiles that are digitized from 1:24,000 scale Wisconsin Wetland Inventory (WWI) maps. The point coverage includes information for wetlands smaller than 2 or 5 acres (depending on year), dammed ponds and excavated ponds.
