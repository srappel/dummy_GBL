{"dct_title_s": "County Boundary Polygons Illinois 2003","dct_description_sm": ["This polygon data layer represents counties for Illinois in 2003. The dataset was originally published by the Illinois State Geological Survey in June 2003.[This data set contains Illinois county polygons. The data were extracted from, and are redundant with, ISGS feature dataset IL_Public_Land_Survey_System. The data set is maintained as a separate entity for ease of query and display. The polygon attributes indicate county name and and FIPS code. The nominal scale is 1:62,500. As of 2003, the data are typically distributed in geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude), decimal degrees, and the North American Datum (NAD) of 1983, and this is the default spatial reference of the ArcSDE feature dataset in which the data are stored. The data were originally developed, however, in a custom Lambert Conformal Conic projection and were distributed in that coordinate system for several years. The data were digitized in the late 1960s and in 1984-85 from 7.5- and 15-minute USGS topographic quadrangles. Errors in the location of a given feature are dependent on the accuracy of the original maps and on the accuracy of digitizing. Estimates are that features have an average locational error of at least plus/minus 100 feet.]"],"dct_language_sm": ["eng"],"dct_creator_sm": [],"dct_publisher_sm": ["Illinois State Geological Survey"],"schema_provider_s": "American Geographical Society Library â€“ UWM Libraries","gbl_resourceClass_sm": ["Datasets"],"gbl_resourceType_sm": ["Polygon data"],"dcat_theme_sm": ["Boundaries"],"dct_temporal_sm": ["2003"],"dct_issued_s": "2003","gbl_indexYear_im": [2003],"dct_spatial_sm": ["Illinois"],"locn_geometry": "ENVELOPE(-87.495214, -91.513518, 42.508348, 36.969972)","dcat_bbox": "ENVELOPE(-91.513518, -87.495214, 42.508348, 36.969972)","dct_rights_sm": ["<a href=\"https://uwm.edu/libraries/digital-collections/copyright-digcoll/\">Please see the UWM Libraries statement on Copyright and Digital Collections</a>.[Reproduction or redistribution of copyrighted digital data sets or products derived therefrom outside of licensee's organization or entity is expressly forbidden.
