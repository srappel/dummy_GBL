This point data layer represents wetlands for Kenosha County, Wisconsin in 2005. They are feature classes with in the geodatabase KenoshaCounty_Wetlands_2005.gdb. The dataset was originally published by the Southeast Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission (SEWRPC) in 2005.[This data set consists of digital map files containing point, line, and polygon features of wetland information covering Kenosha, Milwaukee, Ozaukee, Racine, Walworth, Washington, and Waukesha Counties. The files were compiled by the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission on behalf of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources as part of a cooperative agreement to update the Wisconsin Wetland Inventory in Southeastern Wisconsin. Each file covers one U.S. Public Land Survey System survey township, for a total of 82 files in the data set. The digital map files were compiled with reference to one-inch-equals-100-feet-scale and one-inch-equals-200-feet-scale orthophotography acquired in the Spring of 2005, and also with reference to land use, vegetation, topographic, and soils information. The digital map files are available in ESRI geodatabase format.]"],"dct_language_sm": ["eng"],"dct_creator_sm": ["Southeast Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission-Land Use Division and GIS Division"],"dct_publisher_sm": ["Southeast Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission-Land Use Division and GIS Division"],"schema_provider_s": "American Geographical Society Library â€“ UWM Libraries","gbl_resourceClass_sm": ["Datasets"],"gbl_resourceType_sm": ["Point data","Polygon data"],"dcat_theme_sm": ["Biology","Inland Waters"],"dct_temporal_sm": ["2005"],"dct_issued_s": "2008","gbl_indexYear_im": [2005],"dct_spatial_sm": ["Kenosha County","Wisconsin"],"locn_geometry": "ENVELOPE(-87.798242, -88.309083, 42.675941, 42.486489)","dcat_bbox": "ENVELOPE(-88.309083, -87.798242, 42.675941, 42.486489)","dct_rights_sm": ["<a href=\"https://uwm.edu/libraries/digital-collections/copyright-digcoll/\">Please see the UWM Libraries statement on Copyright and Digital Collections</a>.[The wetland delineations in this data set were compiled with reference to large-scale orthophotography obtained in April and May 2005.
