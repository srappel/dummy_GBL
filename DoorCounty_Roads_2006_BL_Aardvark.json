The dataset was originally published by the Door County Planning and Zoning Department in 2006.[Roads4 is Door County's roads theme for the County. The theme is a work in progress by the Door County Planning Department as the Rural Addressing Program for the County is implemented. The City of Sturgeon Bay and the four Villages in the County will most likely be the last to be updated, as the Door County Planning Department currently administers the Addressing records for the rural portions of the County only. It is the plan of the County to update the City and four Villages, after the Towns have been inventoried and are in a maintenance mode.]"],"dct_language_sm": ["eng"],"dct_creator_sm": ["Door County Planning and Zoning Department"],"dct_publisher_sm": ["Door County Planning and Zoning Department"],"schema_provider_s": "American Geographical Society Library â€“ UWM Libraries","gbl_resourceClass_sm": ["Datasets"],"gbl_resourceType_sm": ["Line data"],"dcat_theme_sm": ["Transportation"],"dct_temporal_sm": ["2006"],"dct_issued_s": "2006","gbl_indexYear_im": [2006],"dct_spatial_sm": ["Door County","Wisconsin"],"locn_geometry": "ENVELOPE(-86.82283, -87.735334, 45.435418, 44.656414)","dcat_bbox": "ENVELOPE(-87.735334, -86.82283, 45.435418, 44.656414)","dct_rights_sm": ["<a href=\"https://uwm.edu/libraries/digital-collections/copyright-digcoll/\">Please see the UWM Libraries statement on Copyright and Digital Collections</a>.","Although this data is being distributed by the American Geographical Society Library at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Libraries, no warranty expressed or implied is made by the University as to the accuracy of the data and related materials.
