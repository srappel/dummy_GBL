The spatial resolution of the dataset is 10 meters. The dataset was originally published by the Dane County Land Information Office and Fly Dane Partnership on March 26, 2010. [The Bare Earth DEM was developed from LAS points and breaklines collected from a LiDAR flight flown in the Spring and Fall of 2009, as part of the Fly Dane 2009-2010 Project. The DEM is a raster data set in ESRI GRID format with an X, Y, Z value located at the center of each 10 ft. by 10 ft. cell. The DEM was generated from a DTM meeting National Map Accuracy Standards.]"],"dct_language_sm": ["eng"],"dct_creator_sm": ["Dane County Land Information Office"],"dct_publisher_sm": ["Dane County Land Information Office"],"schema_provider_s": "American Geographical Society Library â€“ UWM Libraries","gbl_resourceClass_sm": ["Datasets"],"dcat_theme_sm": ["Elevation"],"dct_temporal_sm": ["2009-04-01 to 2009-11-01"],"dct_issued_s": "2010","gbl_indexYear_im": [2009],"gbl_dateRange_drsim" : "[2009 TO 2009]","dct_spatial_sm": ["Dane County","Wisconsin"],"locn_geometry": "ENVELOPE(-89.364138, -89.384286, 43.089943, 43.074324)","dcat_bbox": "ENVELOPE(-89.384286, -89.364138, 43.089943, 43.074324)","dct_rights_sm": ["<a href=\"https://uwm.edu/libraries/digital-collections/copyright-digcoll/\">Please see the UWM Libraries statement on Copyright and Digital Collections</a>.[Refer to the License Agreement for Dane County Digital Geographic Data Sets, http://www.co.dane.wi.us/lio/gis/licenseaggreement.pdf.][Data is copyright and licensed for use.]","Although this data is being distributed by the American Geographical Society Library at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Libraries, no warranty expressed or implied is made by the University as to the accuracy of the data and related materials.
