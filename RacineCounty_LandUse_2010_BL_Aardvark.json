The dataset was originally published by the Southeast Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission (SEWRPC) in 2010.[The 2010 Land Use Inventory data set contains polygon features showing land use delineations for the seven-county Southeastern Wisconsin Region, covering Kenosha, Milwaukee, Ozaukee, Racine, Walworth, Washington, and Waukesha Counties. Previous land use data sets were collected at approximately 5-year intervals, and are current for the years 1963, 1970, 1980, 1985, 1990, 1995, and 2000. The polygon features were originally delineated on 1\"=400' scale aerial photographs and board digitized. Recent inventories have been collected utilizing digital orthophotography and digital property boundary lines. The land use polygons are identified according to the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission's (SEWRPC) land use classification system.]"],"dct_language_sm": ["eng"],"dct_creator_sm": ["Southeast Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission-Land Use Division and GIS Division"],"schema_provider_s": "American Geographical Society Library â€“ UWM Libraries","gbl_resourceClass_sm": ["Datasets"],"gbl_resourceType_sm": ["Polygon data"],"dcat_theme_sm": ["Property"],"dct_temporal_sm": ["2010"],"dct_issued_s": "2010","gbl_indexYear_im": [2010],"dct_spatial_sm": ["Racine County","Wisconsin"],"locn_geometry": "ENVELOPE(-87.755128, -88.312621, 42.850185, 42.601303)","dcat_bbox": "ENVELOPE(-88.312621, -87.755128, 42.850185, 42.601303)","dct_rights_sm": ["<a href=\"https://uwm.edu/libraries/digital-collections/copyright-digcoll/\">Please see the UWM Libraries statement on Copyright and Digital Collections</a>.
