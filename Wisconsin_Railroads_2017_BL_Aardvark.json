The dataset was originally published by the United States Cenus Bureau in 2017.[The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. The Rails Shapefile includes all features within the MTDB Super Class \"Rail Features\" distinguished where the MAF/TIGER Feature Classification Code (MTFCC) for the feature in MTDB that begin with \"R\". This includes main lines such as spur lines, rail yards, mass transit rail lines such as carlines, streetcar track, monorail or other mass transit rail and special purpose rail lines such as cog rail lines, incline rail lines and trams.]"],"dct_language_sm": ["eng"],"dct_creator_sm": ["United States Census Bureau"],"schema_provider_s": "American Geographical Society Library â€“ UWM Libraries","gbl_resourceClass_sm": ["Datasets"],"gbl_resourceType_sm": ["Line data"],"dcat_theme_sm": ["Transportation"],"dct_temporal_sm": ["2017"],"dct_issued_s": "2017","gbl_indexYear_im": [2017],"dct_spatial_sm": ["Wisconsin"],"locn_geometry": "ENVELOPE(-87.573036, -92.803943, 46.808442, 42.492741)","dcat_bbox": "ENVELOPE(-92.803943, -87.573036, 46.808442, 42.492741)","dct_rights_sm": ["<a href=\"https://uwm.edu/libraries/digital-collections/copyright-digcoll/\">Please see the UWM Libraries statement on Copyright and Digital Collections</a>.[The TIGER/Line Shapefile products are not copyrighted however TIGER/Line and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the U.S. Census Bureau.
