It is a companion to the SEWRPC Environmental Corridor Inventory data set. The planned environmental corridor data set is the inventory environmental corridor data set adjusted to reflect planned additions to, and deletions from, the inventory environmental corridors and isolated natural resource areas identified in the regional land use plan, water quality management plan, or park and open space plan, including amendments to these plans, adopted by the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission. The polygon features were derived from existing environmental corridor inventory data sets for the years 1990, 1995, and 2000 (the existing environmental corridor data sets were originally extracted from land use inventory maps and 1\"=400' scale aerial photographs). The polygon features consist of planned primary and planned secondary environmental corridor areas and planned isolated natural resource areas as defined by SEWRPC. ]"],"dct_language_sm": ["eng"],"dct_creator_sm": ["Mike Gosetti (SEWRPC) (GIS Manager, Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission)"],"schema_provider_s": "American Geographical Society Library","gbl_resourceClass_sm": ["Datasets"],"gbl_resourceType_sm": ["Polygon data"],"dcat_theme_sm": ["Biology","Environment"],"dct_temporal_sm": ["2000"],"dct_issued_s": "2000","gbl_indexYear_im": [2000],"dct_spatial_sm": ["Milwaukee County","Wisconsin"],"locn_geometry": "ENVELOPE(-87.812986, -88.074273, 43.195098, 42.83888)","dcat_bbox": "ENVELOPE(-88.074273, -87.812986, 43.195098, 42.83888)","dct_rights_sm": ["Please see the UWM Libraries statement on Copyright and the UWM Librariesâ€™ Digital Collections[This data set was prepared from aerial photography, land use maps, and existing environmental corridor maps.
